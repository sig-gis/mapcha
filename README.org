* Mapcha Website

This is the web interface for Spatial Informatics Group's Image
Analysis Crowdsourcing Platform (Mapcha).

** Usage

To run this web application, you will need:

1) Sun's JDK 1.8+
2) Boot 2.5.5+
3) Postgresql 9.5+
4) PostGIS 2.2+

Begin by following the Database Initialization instructions at the end
of this file to create a new database for your Mapcha installation.

Then simply enter the toplevel project directory (the same one
containing this README file), and instruct Boot to run the web
application as follows:

  In development mode:
  $ boot dev

  In production mode:
  $ boot site

Both commands will start a web server running the Mapcha website.
Connect to it by pointing your web browser at http://localhost:8080.

In development mode, connect to the local nrepl server with your IDE
or using boot from the command-line:

  $ boot repl --client

Then run (start-repl) from the Clojure prompt and refresh your browser
to activate a browser-backed ClojureScript repl.

** Database Initialization

1. Install the latest versions of Postgresql and PostGIS.

2. Start the Postgresql database server running on your machine on the
   default port (5432).

3. From your shell, run "psql -U postgres" to connect as the database
   superuser.

4. At the psql prompt, run these commands:

   CREATE ROLE mapcha WITH LOGIN CREATEDB;
   CREATE DATABASE mapcha WITH OWNER mapcha;
   \c mapcha
   CREATE EXTENSION postgis;

   This will create a new database called "mapcha" owned by user
   "mapcha" and add the PostGIS spatial extensions to it.

5. From your shell, run "psql -U mapcha -f build_mapcha_tables.sql -d
   mapcha" to populate the new mapcha database with the table schema
   expected by the website code. This SQL file can be found under
   resources/sql in the toplevel project directory.

6. Launch the Mapcha website by running "boot dev" from within the
   mapcha directory that you cloned from GitHub.

7. Point your web browser at http://localhost:8080 to access the site.

8. Register a new user account called "admin@sig-gis.com" with whatever
   password you like.

9. From your shell, run "psql -U mapcha -d mapcha" to connect to the
   mapcha database as the mapcha user.

10. At the psql prompt, run this command to elevate admin@sig-gis.com
    to the admin role.

    UPDATE mapcha.users
      SET role='admin'
      WHERE email='admin@sig-gis.com';

11. Logout and back in as admin@sig-gis.com on the Mapcha website. You
    should now see the Account, Dashboard, and Admin links added to
    the navigation bar.

12. Visit the Admin link and create a new project. All fields must be
    filled in. To input the bounding box coordinates, use ctrl+drag on
    the map interface. You can repeat this as many times as you would
    like, and it will always save the last bounding box drawn this
    way. Remember to enter several sample value categories (try 6-8 to
    start with) along with sensible colors.
